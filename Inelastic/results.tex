\section{Results}
In an exposure of 34~Kg per 224~days of liquid xenon a yield of 764 events are found in the region of interest,
which is compatible with the expectation of $756 \, \pm \, 5^{(stat.)} \, \pm 55^{(syst.)}$. The distribution 
of events from data are compared to the background expectation in Figure~\ref{fig:dataVSbkg} and with the relative
uncertainties.  
This result is interpreted via a binned profiled likelihood approach by means of the test statistic $\tilde{q}$
and its asymptotic distributions described in \cite{asympt}. 90\% CL$_s$ \cite{cls} confidence level limits are 
computed on the spin dependent cross section as a function of the WIMP mass and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:limits}.
